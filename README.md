# furries
furries is a simple twitter bot inspired by a still from a news program about the furry community in Pittsburgh featuring three fursuiters and the text "The Furries Are Back".

It uses my natural language generation library [verbly](https://github.com/hatkirby/verbly) to pick words, [YAMLcpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) to read a configuration file, and my C++ Twitter library [libtwitter++](https://github.com/hatkirby/libtwittercpp) to send the status updates to Twitter.

The canonical furries handle is [@thefurriesare](https://twitter.com/thefurriesare).
